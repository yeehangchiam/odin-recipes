        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple, no frills biscotti. My friend at work gave this recipe to me. It's quick, easy and one of my favorite Italian cookie recipes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon anise extract, or 3 drops anise oil</li>   
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, beat together the oil, eggs, sugar and
                 anise flavoring until well blended. Combine the flour and
                  baking powder, stir into the egg mixture to form a heavy
                   dough. Divide dough into two pieces. Form each piece into
                    a roll as long as your cookie sheet. Place roll onto the
                     prepared cookie sheet, and press down to 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
                 Remove from the baking sheet to cool on a wire rack.
                  When The cookies are cool enough to handle, slice each one crosswise into 1/2 inch slices.
                   Place the slices cut side up back onto the baking sheet.
                    Bake for an additional 6 to 10 minutes on each side.
                     Slices should be lightly toasted.</li>
        </ol>
